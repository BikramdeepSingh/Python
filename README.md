# Python

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming 
language. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented
approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for 
small and large-scale projects.

Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time 
programmer or you're experienced with other languages. 
The following pages are a useful first step to get on your 
way writing programs with Python!



## Python / Inventor (Guido van Rossum)


When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was 
also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's 
Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. 
Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, 
and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.
