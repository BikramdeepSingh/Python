# Python

In a programming language like Python, the syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written and the semantics is the effects the instructions have. 

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages. The following pages are a useful first step to get on your 
way writing programs with Python!

In this repo, I have included some concepts which a beginner will find useful in the start and will enjoy writing codes in python.



## Python / Inventor (Guido van Rossum)


When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.


## PIP
pip is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages. It connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index. pip can also be configured to connect to other package repositories, provided that they comply to Python Enhancement Proposal 503.


## Python Fun Facts

* Being named after a comedy show isn’t the only touch of humor. If you type import this into the Python shell, the output is a poem called the Zen of Python written by Tim Peters.
* Google searches for ‘Python programming’ have been higher in number than those for ‘Kim Kardashian’ and even ‘Donald Trump’.
* There are over 150,000 Python packages in the package repository, which is informally known as the Cheese Shop (after a famous Monty Python sketch!)
